                        Flows in CALM 1.0-rc1 describe business-level processes that traverse your technical architecture, providing traceability between business requirements and technical implementation.
                        
                        ## Key Characteristics:
                        ‚Ä¢ **Business Focus**: Flows represent business processes, not just technical data movement
                        ‚Ä¢ **Relationship Mapping**: Each transition must reference an existing relationship in your architecture
                        ‚Ä¢ **Sequential**: Transitions are ordered by sequence-number to show process flow
                        ‚Ä¢ **Directional**: Each transition specifies direction (source-to-destination or destination-to-source)
                        ‚Ä¢ **Traceable**: Links business requirements to technical components
                        
                        ## Required Properties:
                        ‚Ä¢ **unique-id**: Unique identifier for the flow
                        ‚Ä¢ **name**: Descriptive business name for the flow
                        ‚Ä¢ **description**: Detailed explanation of the flow's business purpose
                        ‚Ä¢ **transitions**: Array of at least one transition (the actual flow steps)
                        
                        ## Optional Properties:
                        ‚Ä¢ **requirement-url**: Link to detailed business requirements
                        ‚Ä¢ **controls**: Security, compliance, or governance controls applied to the flow
                        ‚Ä¢ **metadata**: Additional context (SLAs, business owners, compliance info, etc.)
                        
                        ## Transition Properties:
                        ‚Ä¢ **relationship-unique-id**: Must match an existing relationship in your architecture
                        ‚Ä¢ **sequence-number**: Integer indicating the order of this step in the flow
                        ‚Ä¢ **summary**: Business description of what happens in this transition
                        ‚Ä¢ **direction**: "source-to-destination" (default) or "destination-to-source"
                        
                        ## Common Flow Patterns:
                        ‚Ä¢ **User Journeys**: Login, registration, checkout, profile management
                        ‚Ä¢ **Business Processes**: Order processing, payment flows, approval workflows
                        ‚Ä¢ **Data Flows**: ETL processes, synchronization, reporting pipelines
                        ‚Ä¢ **Integration Flows**: API orchestration, event-driven processes
                        ‚Ä¢ **Compliance Flows**: Audit trails, regulatory reporting, data governance
                        
                        ## Best Practices:
                        ‚Ä¢ **Business Language**: Use business terminology in names and descriptions
                        ‚Ä¢ **Complete Flows**: Include all significant steps from start to finish
                        ‚Ä¢ **Relationship Validation**: Ensure all referenced relationships exist in your architecture
                        ‚Ä¢ **Logical Sequencing**: Use sequence numbers that allow for future insertions (10, 20, 30...)
                        ‚Ä¢ **Meaningful Summaries**: Each transition summary should explain the business value
                        ‚Ä¢ **Control Integration**: Add relevant security and compliance controls
                        ‚Ä¢ **Metadata Enrichment**: Include SLAs, business owners, and operational context
                        
                        ## Validation Rules:
                        ‚Ä¢ All relationship-unique-id values must reference existing relationships
                        ‚Ä¢ Sequence numbers should be unique within a flow
                        ‚Ä¢ At least one transition is required per flow
                        ‚Ä¢ Direction values must be valid enum values
                        ‚Ä¢ Controls and metadata follow their respective schema definitions
                        """
