# CALM Visualizer Extension

This extension will take a valid CALM specification and provide a visualization for it in a new VSCode tab.

## Features

The extension contributes a command to the VSCode command pallette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) called "CALM: Start a new CALM Visualization window".
Running this command will open up the visualization in a new tab.
